## Introduction

ResNet101 is a deep convolutional neural network architecture known for its success in image classification tasks. This implementation provides a clean and modular codebase for understanding and using the ResNet101 architecture.

## Architecture

The ResNet101 model is implemented using PyTorch. The architecture includes residual blocks, custom dataset handling, and evaluation and visualization components.

- **ResidualBlock**: Defines the building block for the ResNet model.
- **ResNet101v2**: Implements the overall ResNet101 architecture.

## Dataset

The implementation includes a custom dataset class for handling image data. You can easily replace the dataset with your own by modifying the `CustomDataset` class.

## Evaluation and Visualization

The `EvaluateVisualization` class provides methods for plotting loss curves and confusion matrices during model evaluation.

## Training

The `ResNetTrainer` class encapsulates the training process, making it easy to train the ResNet101 model on your dataset.

## Usage

To use this implementation, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/resnet101-implementation.git
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Modify the dataset path in the `main.py` file:

    ```python
    data_dir = "path/to/your/dataset"
    ```

4. Run the training script:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
